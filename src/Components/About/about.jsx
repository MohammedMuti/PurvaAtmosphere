            residential floors. Two towers comprises of 2 & 3 bed units while
            the central tower has larger 3 and 4 bed units. The central tower is
            topped with a Sky club on the 34th floor, which links to landscaped
            terraces of the other two towers, providing a large community space
            in the sky, probably the current highest in Bangalore amongst
            residential projects.Terraces have been designed to create a unique
            sky garden with Decks, Play Areas, Activity Zones and Landscaped
            Zones. They act as extensions to the Clubhouse and offer a clear
            unobstructed view on all sides. Some of the unique features of the
            club include a glass sky bridge and a cantilever viewing area with
            glass floors, providing an exhilarating view below. The 32nd floor
            has a lower level landscape terrace with a unique cantilevered sky
            deck letting one be with the sky/atmosphere and enjoy stunning views
            of the city skyline.

            The three towers are designed to be sleek, minimal, contemporary and
            international in character with abundant natural light and
            ventilation for all living spaces. They are bold with a strong
            rectangular geometry, yet minimal, understated elegance and
            timeless. Utmost care is taken to minimize wastage of internal
            spaces within each apartment with minimal or no corridors in most
            apartments. Each tower has a grand double height lobby accessed from
            the grand drop off arrival zone. This leads to lift lobbies which
            have views through each tower with natural light and ventilation. A
            large swimming pool is built on the podium with infinity edge water
            feature that cascades down from the podium to the arrival zone
            below. Two grand stairs abutting the water cascade lead visitors
            from the main drop off area to the landscaped podiums enhancing the
            arrival experience.
